# 24game

Welcome to the world of math! Pick up your calculator, and raise it high to the sky. On second thought, don't use a caculator, that is cheating.

<ul>
	<li>The goal is to get the number 24</li>
	<li>You have to use <strong>all 4 numbers</strong></li>
	<li>You can use as many operators as you want</li>
	<li>If the task seems impossible, it just might be. Hit "new game".</li>
	<li>Good luck!</li>
</ul>

Oh, one last thing: Go for speed, not creativity! We don't reward being smart...
